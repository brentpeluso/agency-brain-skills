# Remodeler Strategy Session

**Goal:** Turn "I need a campaign" into a fully defined **Offer & Hook Strategy** ready for planning.

## Brainstorming Workflow

Copy this checklist:
```
Strategy Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Define Avatar & Pain (Who are we saving?)
- [ ] Step 2: Build the Value Equation (The "Grand Slam" components)
- [ ] Step 3: Generate 3 Hook Angles (Educational, Direct, or Story)
- [ ] Step 4: Select the "Vehicle" (Facebook Ad, Cold Email, Database Reactivation)
- [ ] Step 5: Finalize the "Campaign Brief"
```

## The Process

### Step 1: Define Avatar & Pain
Ask questions to fill:
- **Avatar:** (e.g., "Homeowners in Seattle with dated kitchens")
- **Pain:** (e.g., "Embarrassed to host, low functionality, afraid of renovation horror stories")

### Step 2: Build the Value Equation
Propose ideas for each lever:
- **Dream Outcome:** "Chef's Kitchen in 3 weeks"
- **Perc. Likelihood:** "License #, 50+ Reviews, 'Don't Pay Until Done' guarantee"
- **Time Delay:** "Quote in 24h, Start in 14 days"
- **Effort/Sacrifice:** "We handle permits, daily cleanup service"

### Step 3: Hook Angles (The "Big Idea")
Present 3 distinct angles for the campaign.
*Example:*
1.  **Direct:** "Get a Luxury Kitchen for $350/mo."
2.  **Pain/Problem:** "Sign your kitchen is killing your home value."
3.  **Story:** "How the Smith family remodelled without moving out."

### Step 4: The Vehicle
Decide where this lives:
- **Landing Page Funnel?**
- **Lead Form Ad?**
- **Database Reactivation (SMS/Email)?**

## Output: The Campaign Brief

Once decided, write this to `docs/strategies/YYYY-MM-DD-[campaign-name].md`:

```markdown
# Campaign Brief: [Name]

## Core Offer
[One sentence Grand Slam Offer]

## The Hook
[Selected Headline/Angle]

## Assets Needed
- [ ] Ad Creative (Image/Video)
- [ ] Landing Page (Hero, Trust, Form)
- [ ] Automation (Lead Notification, SMS 1, Email 1)
```

**Next Step:** "Strategy defined. Shall I use `planning` to map out the technical build?"
