# Remodeler Booked: High-Performance Home Page Blueprint

## ⚡ Speed Optimization Rules (CRITICAL)
*   **Images**: ALL images must be converted to **WebP** format and compressed to under 100kb (use [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/)).
*   **Video**: Do NOT upload videos to GHL directly. Embed from YouTube/Vimeo/Wistia with "Lazy Load" enabled.
*   **Animations**: Disable GHL "Entry Animations" (Fade in, Slide up) on the Hero section to improve LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).
*   **Fonts**: We are using Google Fonts (Montserrat/Open Sans). In GHL Settings, ensure "Optimize Fonts" is checked if available.

## 🎨 Implementation Tips
1.  **Padding**: Use **80px top/bottom padding** on every section to give it that "clean, premium" look.
2.  **Mobile**: Check the "Mobile Font Size" on headings. H1 should be `28px` on mobile, `48px` on desktop.
3.  **Consistency**: Do not change colors manually. Use the bold/color selector in the text editor or your global classes.
