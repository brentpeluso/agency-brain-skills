# Remodeler Booked - Website Redesign Plan

This plan outlines the exact changes needed to transform the current generic template into a high-converting "Remodeler Booked" authority site.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Global CSS**: Ensure you have pasted the content from `ghl-global.css` into your Website Settings > Custom CSS area before starting. This locks in your Montserrat/Open Sans fonts and Brand Colors.

## 2. Page-by-Page Redesign Blueprints

### A. Home Page (The "Sales Letter")
**Goal**: Identify the problem (bad leads) and sell the destination (booked jobs).

*   **Hero Section**:
    *   **Headline (H1)**: "Stop Chasing Tire-Kickers. Start Booking Grand Slam Remodels."
    *   **Subheadline**: "The all-in-one growth system for home remodelers who are tired of 'shared leads' and empty calendars."
    *   **Background**: High-quality image of a stunning kitchen remodel (lightly overlaid with dark navy transparency for text readability).
    *   **CTA**: [Book Your Strategy Call]
*   **The "Old Way" vs. "New Way" Section**:
    *   *Create a 2-Column Row.*
    *   **Left (Red X)**: "The Angie's List" Trap - Fighting 5 other contractors for the same low-quality lead.
    *   **Right (Green Check)**: "The Remodeler Booked" System - Exclusive leads, automated booking, and pre-qualified homeowners.
*   **Services Preview (3-Column)**:
    *   1. **Lead Generation** (Icon: Magnet) - "We find homeowners ready to renovate."
    *   2. **Lead Nurture** (Icon: Chat Bubble) - "Our AI follows up until they book."
    *   3. **Reputation** (Icon: Star) - "We get you 5-star Google Reviews automatically."

### B. Services Page (The "Mechanism")
**Goal**: Explain *how* it works without boring them with tech jargon.

*   **Headline**: "Your Entire Marketing Department in One Box."
*   **Service Breakdown (Alternating Layouts)**:
    *   **Feature 1: The Booking Bot**
        *   *Copy*: "Missed calls cost you money. Our system texts back leads instantly—within 2 minutes—so you never lose a job to speed."
    *   **Feature 2: The Ad Engine**
        *   *Copy*: "We don't sell shared leads. We build YOUR brand with ads that target high-income homeowners in your specific zip codes."
    *   **Feature 3: The Database Reactivator**
        *   *Copy*: "You're sitting on a goldmine. We text your past leads to fill your calendar next week."

### C. Case Studies (The "Proof")
**Goal**: Show, don't just tell.

*   **Headline**: "See What's Possible."
*   **Layout**: Grid of Cards. Each card should have:
    *   **Image**: "Before" (Messy/Old) vs "After" (Stunning Result) - *Metaphor for their business growth.*
    *   **Stats**: "Added $150k in Pipeline in 30 Days."
    *   **Client**: "Kitchen Specialists of [City]"
    *   **Video**: (Optional) Loom/Testimonial video embed.

### D. Pricing (The "Offer")
**Goal**: Anchor the value.

*   **Headline**: "Simple Pricing. Massive ROI."
*   **Strategy**: If you have fixed tiered pricing, list it. If not, swap this for a **"Who This Is For"** section to filter leads.
*   **Recommended tiers**:
    *   **Standard**: (Tools Only) - DIY System.
    *   **Growth**: (Done-With-You) - Ads + System.
    *   **Partner**: (Done-For-You) - We handle everything.
