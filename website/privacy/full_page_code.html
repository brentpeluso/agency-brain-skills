                        professional handling sensitive client information. We are committed to protecting the privacy
                        of your personally-identifiable information as you use this website. This Privacy Policy tells
                        you how we protect and use information that we gather from you. By using this website, you
                        consent to the terms described in the most recent version of this Privacy Policy. You should
                        also read our Terms of Use to understand the general rules about your use of this website, and
                        any additional terms that may apply when you access particular services or materials on certain

                    <h3>PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>Our Privacy Policy identifies how we treat your personal and non-personal information in
                        compliance with industry standards.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED AND USED?</h3>
                    <p>Non-personal information is information that cannot identify you. If you visit this website to
                        read information, such as information about our remodeling marketing services, we may collect
                        certain non-personal information about you from your computer's web browser. Because
                        non-personal information cannot identify you or be tied to you in any way, there are no
                        restrictions on the ways that we can use or share non-personal information.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED?</h3>
                    <p>Personal information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name,
                        business name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, and company information. We may
                        collect personal information from you in a variety of ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When you send us an application or consultation request form</li>
                        <li>When you schedule a consultation with us or our team</li>
                        <li>When we collect information about you in support of our marketing services</li>
                        <li>In some places on this website you have the opportunity to send us personal information
                            about yourself, to elect to receive particular information about remodeling marketing
                            strategies, to access our resources, or to participate in webinars or educational activities
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>ARE COOKIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USED TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to collect information on
                        our website. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.
                        Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely
                        assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to
                        you.</p>
                    <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
                        purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
                        example, if you register for our kitchen remodeling marketing resources, a cookie helps Remodel
                        Booked to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
                        accessing your customized marketing materials and business-specific resources.</p>
                    <p>We may use web beacons to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how remodeling
                        professionals navigate our website, and we may include web beacons in email messages to track
                        engagement with our educational content.</p>
                    <p>Third party vendors also may use cookies on our website. For instance, we may contract with third
                        parties who will use cookies on our website to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume
                        statistical information from our visitors and members. Such information is shared externally
                        only on an anonymous, aggregated basis.</p>
