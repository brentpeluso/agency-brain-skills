                <p>Remodel Booked understands that your privacy is important to you, especially as a business
                    professional handling sensitive client information. We are committed to protecting the privacy of
                    your personally-identifiable information as you use this website. This Privacy Policy tells you how
                    we protect and use information that we gather from you. By using this website, you consent to the
                    terms described in the most recent version of this Privacy Policy. You should also read our Terms of
                    Use to understand the general rules about your use of this website, and any additional terms that
                    may apply when you access particular services or materials on certain areas of this website. "We,"
                    "our" means Remodel Booked and its affiliates. "You," "your," "visitor," or "user" means the
                    individual accessing this site.</p>

                <h3>PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                <p>Our Privacy Policy identifies how we treat your personal and non-personal information in compliance
                    with industry standards.</p>

                <h3>WHAT IS NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED AND USED?</h3>
                <p>Non-personal information is information that cannot identify you. If you visit this website to read
                    information, such as information about our remodeling marketing services, we may collect certain
                    non-personal information about you from your computer's web browser. Because non-personal
                    information cannot identify you or be tied to you in any way, there are no restrictions on the ways
                    that we can use or share non-personal information.</p>

                <h3>WHAT IS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED?</h3>
                <p>Personal information is information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name, business
                    name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, and company information. We may collect
                    personal information from you in a variety of ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you send us an application or consultation request form</li>
                    <li>When you schedule a consultation with us or our team</li>
                    <li>When we collect information about you in support of our marketing services</li>
                    <li>In some places on this website you have the opportunity to send us personal information about
                        yourself, to elect to receive particular information about remodeling marketing strategies, to
                        access our resources, or to participate in webinars or educational activities</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>ARE COOKIES OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES USED TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we may use cookies and related technologies, such as web beacons, to collect information on our
                    website. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies
                    cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to
                    you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
                <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
                    purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
                    example, if you register for our kitchen remodeling marketing resources, a cookie helps Remodel
                    Booked to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of
                    accessing your customized marketing materials and business-specific resources.</p>
                <p>We may use web beacons to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how remodeling professionals
                    navigate our website, and we may include web beacons in email messages to track engagement with our
                    educational content.</p>
                <p>Third party vendors also may use cookies on our website. For instance, we may contract with third
                    parties who will use cookies on our website to track and analyze anonymous usage and volume
                    statistical information from our visitors and members. Such information is shared externally only on
                    an anonymous, aggregated basis.</p>
