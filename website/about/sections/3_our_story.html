                        Before we were marketers, we were deeply embedded in the construction world. We saw incredible
                        craftsmen struggling to find quality leads, wasting thousands on "SEO gurus" who didn't know the
                        difference between a load-bearing wall and a backsplash.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2018, we decided to change that. We built <span class="text-[#437453] font-bold">Remodel
                            Booked</span> with one goal: To bridge the gap between high-end remodeling expertise and
                        cutting-edge digital marketing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We don't work with plumbers, lawyers, or dentists. We work exclusively with <span
                            class="text-[#142B47] font-bold">kitchen and bath remodelers</span>. This
                        hyper-focus allows us to know your customers' pain points and exactly what makes a homeowner
                        click "Book an Estimate."
