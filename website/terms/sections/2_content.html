                <p>This Site and all the materials available on the Site are the property of us and/or our affiliates or
                    licensors, and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. The Site
                    is provided solely for your professional, non-commercial use. You may not use the Site or the
                    materials available on the Site in a manner that constitutes an infringement of our rights or that
                    has not been authorized by us. More specifically, unless explicitly authorized in these Terms of
                    Service or by the owner of the materials, you may not modify, copy, reproduce, republish, upload,

                    non-commercial use, provided that you keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices.</p>

                <h4>Your License to Us</h4>
                <p>By posting or submitting any material (including, without limitation, comments, testimonials, case
                    studies, photos and videos) to us via the Site, internet groups, social media venues, or to any of
                    our staff via email, text or otherwise, you are representing: (i) that you are the owner of the
                    material, or are making your posting or submission with the express consent of the owner of the
                    material; and (ii) that you are thirteen years of age or older. In addition, when you submit, email,
                    text or deliver or post any material, you are granting us, and anyone authorized by us, a
                    royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to use, copy,
                    modify, transmit, sell, exploit, create derivative works from, distribute, and/or publicly perform
                    or display such material, in whole or in part, in any manner or medium, now known or hereafter
                    developed, for any purpose. The foregoing grant shall include the right to exploit any proprietary
                    rights in such posting or submission, including, but not limited to, rights under copyright,
                    trademark, service mark or patent laws under any relevant jurisdiction. Also, in connection with the
                    exercise of such rights, you grant us, and anyone authorized by us, the right to identify you as the
                    author of any of your postings or submissions by name, email address or screen name, as we deem
                    appropriate.</p>
                <p>You acknowledge and agree that any contributions originally created by you for us shall be deemed a
                    "work made for hire" when the work performed is within the scope of the definition of a work made
                    for hire in Section 101 of the United States Copyright Law, as amended. As such, the copyrights in
                    those works shall belong to Remodel Booked from their creation. Thus, Remodel Booked shall be deemed
                    the author and exclusive owner thereof and shall have the right to exploit any or all of the results
                    and proceeds in any and all media, now known or hereafter devised, throughout the universe, in
                    perpetuity, in all languages, as Remodel Booked determines.</p>
                <p>You acknowledge that Remodel Booked has the right but not the obligation to use and display any
                    postings or contributions of any kind and that Remodel Booked may elect to cease the use and display
                    of any such materials (or any portion thereof), at any time for any reason whatsoever.</p>
