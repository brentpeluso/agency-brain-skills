# Clients

Organize all client-specific materials here.

## Folder Structure

Each client gets their own folder:

```
clients/
├── [client-name]/
│   ├── README.md           # Client overview, contacts, notes
│   ├── brand/              # Logo, colors, fonts if different from RB defaults
│   └── testimonials/       # Before/after photos, reviews
```

## Naming Convention

- Use lowercase, hyphenated names
- Example: `valley-home-builders`, `premier-kitchens-llc`

## Client README Template

When creating a new client folder, include a README with:

```markdown
# [Client Name]

**Contact:** [Name] | [Email] | [Phone]
**Service Area:** [City/Region]
**Specialties:** Kitchen | Bath | Whole Home | [Other]

## Active Campaigns
- [ ] Campaign name (status)

## Notes
- Key info about the client
```
